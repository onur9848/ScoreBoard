# SOLID Architecture Implementation

This document explains how SOLID principles have been implemented in the ScoreBoard Kotlin project.

## Overview

The project has been refactored to follow SOLID principles, creating a more maintainable, testable, and extensible architecture. The implementation uses **Koin** dependency injection framework and modular service design.

## SOLID Principles Implementation

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) ✅

**Before**: The `GameService` class handled multiple responsibilities:
- Game creation and validation
- Player management
- Score calculations
- Data serialization

**After**: Split into focused services, each with a single responsibility:

```kotlin
IGameManager -> GameManagerService          // Game lifecycle only
IPlayerManager -> PlayerManagerService      // Player operations only  
IScoreCalculator -> ScoreCalculatorService  // Scoring logic only
IGameSerializer -> JsonGameSerializerService // Persistence only
```

Each service focuses on one specific domain, making the code easier to understand, test, and maintain.

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP) ✅

**Implementation**: The system is now open for extension but closed for modification through:

#### Strategy Pattern for Scoring
```kotlin
interface IScoringStrategy {
    fun calculateScores(game: Game): List<SingleScore>
}

// Extensible implementations:
StandardScoringStrategy     // Sum all rounds
AverageScoringStrategy     // Average per round
BestRoundsScoringStrategy  // Best N rounds only
```

#### Extension Functions
```kotlin
// Extends Game functionality without modifying the class
fun Game.hasMinimumPlayers(): Boolean = playerList.size >= 2
fun Game.isReadyToPlay(): Boolean = gameTitle.isNotBlank() && hasMinimumPlayers()
```

#### Pluggable Serialization
```kotlin
interface ISerializationStrategy {
    fun serialize(game: Game?): String?
    fun deserialize(data: String): Game?
}
```

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) ✅

**Implementation**: All interfaces can be substituted with their implementations:

```kotlin
// Any IScoringStrategy implementation can replace another
val calculator1 = ScoreCalculatorService(StandardScoringStrategy())
val calculator2 = ScoreCalculatorService(AverageScoringStrategy())
// Both work identically from client perspective
```

All strategy implementations maintain the same contracts and behavioral expectations.

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) ✅

**Before**: Large `IGameService` interface with many methods:
```kotlin
interface IGameService {
    fun createGame(gameTitle: String): Game?
    fun addPlayer(game: Game?, playerName: String)
    fun addScore(game: Game?, scoreList: List<SingleScore>?): Boolean
    fun getPlayerRoundScore(game: Game, playerId: String, round: Int): Int
    fun getCalculatedScore(game: Game): List<SingleScore>
    fun serializeGame(game: Game?): String?
    fun deserializeGame(gameString: String): Game?
}
```

**After**: Focused interfaces that clients can implement as needed:
```kotlin
interface IGameManager {      // Only game lifecycle methods
    fun createGame(gameTitle: String): Game?
    fun validateGame(game: Game?): Boolean
}

interface IPlayerManager {    // Only player operations
    fun addPlayer(game: Game?, playerName: String): Boolean
    fun removePlayer(game: Game?, playerId: String): Boolean
    fun validatePlayerName(playerName: String): Boolean
}

interface IScoreCalculator {  // Only scoring operations
    fun addScore(game: Game?, scoreList: List<SingleScore>?): Boolean
    fun getCalculatedScore(game: Game): List<SingleScore>
}

interface IGameSerializer {   // Only persistence operations
    fun serializeGame(game: Game?): String?
    fun deserializeGame(gameString: String): Game?
}
```

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) ✅

**Implementation**: High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concretions:

#### Dependency Injection Configuration
```kotlin
val appModule = module {
    // Abstractions -> Implementations
    single<IGameManager> { GameManagerService() }
    single<IPlayerManager> { PlayerManagerService() }
    single<IScoreCalculator> { ScoreCalculatorService(scoringStrategy = get()) }
    single<IGameSerializer> { JsonGameSerializerService() }
    
    // Composite for backward compatibility
    single<IGameService> { CompositeGameService(get(), get(), get(), get()) }
    
    viewModel { GameViewModel(gameService = get()) }
}
```

#### ViewModel Dependency Injection
```kotlin
class GameViewModel(
    private val gameService: IGameService  // Depends on abstraction
) : ViewModel() {
    // Implementation uses injected dependency
}
```

#### Activity Dependency Injection
```kotlin
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    private val gameViewModel: GameViewModel by viewModel() // Koin injection
}
```

## Architecture Benefits

### 1. **Maintainability**
- Each service has a single, clear responsibility
- Changes to one service don't affect others
- Easy to locate and fix bugs

### 2. **Testability** 
- Dependencies can be easily mocked
- Each service can be unit tested in isolation
- Clear interfaces make testing straightforward

### 3. **Extensibility**
- New scoring strategies can be added without modifying existing code
- New serialization formats can be plugged in
- Extension functions enhance functionality without modification

### 4. **Flexibility**
- Services can be replaced independently
- Different implementations can be swapped via DI
- Strategy patterns allow runtime behavior changes

### 5. **Code Quality**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Reduced coupling between components
- Consistent abstraction levels

## Usage Examples

### Adding a New Scoring Strategy
```kotlin
class CustomScoringStrategy : IScoringStrategy {
    override fun calculateScores(game: Game): List<SingleScore> {
        // Custom scoring logic
    }
    
    override fun getStrategyName(): String = "Custom Scoring"
    override fun getDescription(): String = "Custom scoring description"
}

// Register in DI module
single<IScoringStrategy> { CustomScoringStrategy() }
```

### Using Extension Functions
```kotlin
val game = Game("Test Game", listOf(player1, player2))

// Enhanced functionality without modifying Game class
if (game.hasMinimumPlayers() && game.isReadyToPlay()) {
    // Start game
}

val winners = calculatedScores.getWinners()
val sortedScores = calculatedScores.sortByScore()
```

### Service Injection
```kotlin
class NewFeatureViewModel(
    private val gameManager: IGameManager,      // Focused dependency
    private val scoreCalculator: IScoreCalculator  // Another focused dependency
) : ViewModel() {
    // Use only the services you need
}
```

## Migration Strategy

The implementation maintains **backward compatibility** through the `CompositeGameService`:

```kotlin
class CompositeGameService(
    private val gameManager: IGameManager,
    private val playerManager: IPlayerManager, 
    private val scoreCalculator: IScoreCalculator,
    private val gameSerializer: IGameSerializer
) : IGameService {
    // Delegates to focused services while maintaining original interface
}
```

This allows existing code to continue working while new code can use the focused interfaces directly.

## Testing Strategy

Each service can now be tested independently:

```kotlin
class GameManagerServiceTest {
    private lateinit var gameManager: IGameManager
    
    @Before
    fun setup() {
        gameManager = GameManagerService()
    }
    
    @Test
    fun `should create game with valid title`() {
        val game = gameManager.createGame("Test Game")
        assertNotNull(game)
        assertEquals("Test Game", game?.gameTitle)
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

The SOLID architecture implementation provides:
- ✅ Clean, maintainable code structure
- ✅ High testability with isolated components  
- ✅ Extensible design for future features
- ✅ Professional dependency injection setup
- ✅ Backward compatibility during migration
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns

This foundation supports long-term maintainability and makes the codebase ready for future enhancements and scaling.
